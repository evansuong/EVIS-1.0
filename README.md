# EVIS-1.0

EVIS is a keyboard controlled lightshow on your device for events like parties, DJ events, lightshows, etc. By pressing various keys, the user can run up to three different effects at the same time. 

Effects are split up into three different categories: Movement effects, Background Effects, and Foreground effects. Only one of each type of effect can be run at the same time. These types are distinguished by the rows on your keyboard which can be found in the help screen by pressing P. This version allows the user to scroll between various background images as well to change up the experience. 

The very first program startup time takes more time than the following startups as evis must generate the manipulated images on its own before reading them into the program. 

Any other functionalities of this program are depicted on the help screen by pressing P.
